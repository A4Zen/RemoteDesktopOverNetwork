# RemoteDesktopOverNetwork
Application written in C# for Remote Desktop Over Network

This was a project for a lesson at my University that takes advantage of some algorithms that will help for faster & a better way to share the desktop over the network from one user to another. Also, it captures logs, statistics, the last frame sent and you have the option to emulate a frame delay & drop.
